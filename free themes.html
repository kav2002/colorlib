            <h3>We change everything WordPress. One WP theme at a time</h3>

            <p class="some-text me-2">With our hand-compiled collection of the best school website templates, you
                can swiftly establish a site for any educational institution. Recruit more students with a
                well-thought-out online presence.</p>

            <p>From students’ admission to exam results can be done on the websites now. It is a must to have a
                modern website for an educational institution. WordPress education themes give you the advanced
                option of having a learning management system on your website.

                Some of you may not need such advanced features for your site. If you need a site only to showcase
                your infrastructure, your courses and to get inquiries, HTML school website templates will do the
                job for you.


            </p>
            <p>HTML website templates have their pros and cons. Of course, they cannot provide you with as many
                features as the WordPress themes give you. But it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use HTML website
                templates. Once you have installed the HTML school website templates with the contents you want, you
                are all set to go.

                You don’t need to consider template updates and other security updates for the HTML templates. If
                you are going to maintain a passive site where you will not update contents a lot, you can choose
                one of these best school website templates.
